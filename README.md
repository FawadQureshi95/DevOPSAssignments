QNo#1 - Agile vs DevOps
Answer: - The key difference between Agile versus DevOps is that Agile is a philosophy about how to develop and deliver software, while DevOps describes how to continuously deploy code through the use of modern tools and automated processes.
QNo#2-Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment

Answer: The Continue Integration is a practice in which different developers comit their code on central code repository and then code is build.
	The Continue Delivery is a practice in which the code committed and by developers is now build and tested .
	The Continue Deployment is a practice in which tested code is now commited to main production branch and then the code or application is deployed in production.

QNo#3:What are the benefits of Cloud Computing
Answer Faster time to market
You can spin up new instances or retire them in seconds, allowing developers to accelerate development with quick deployments. Cloud computing supports new innovations by making it easy to test new ideas and design new applications without hardware limitations or slow procurement processes.

Scalability and flexibility
Cloud computing gives your business more flexibility. You can quickly scale resources and storage up to meet business demands without having to invest in physical infrastructure.

Companies don’t need to pay for or build the infrastructure needed to support their highest load levels. Likewise, they can quickly scale down if resources aren’t being used.  

Cost savings
Whatever cloud service model you choose, you only pay for the resources you actually use. This helps you avoid overbuilding and overprovisioning your data center and gives your IT teams back valuable time to focus on more strategic work. 

Better collaboration
Cloud storage enables you to make data available anywhere you are, anytime you need it. Instead of being tied to a location or specific device, people can access data from anywhere in the world from any device—as long as they have an internet connection.

Advanced security
Despite popular perceptions, cloud computing can actually strengthen your security posture because of the depth and breadth of security features, automatic maintenance, and centralized management.

Reputable cloud providers also hire top security experts and employ the most advanced solutions, providing more robust protection. 

Data loss prevention
Cloud providers offer backup and disaster recovery features. Storing data in the cloud rather than locally can help prevent data loss in the event of an emergency, such as hardware malfunction, malicious threats, or even simple user error.
